# Concept Recommender System for Engineers (CRS)

## Module E – AI Applications (Individual Project)

### Author

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Concept Recommender System (CRS)** is an AI-powered educational tool designed to help engineering students understand technical concepts in a **structured, time-aware, and syllabus-oriented manner**.

Instead of giving long unstructured explanations, the system:
- Adjusts explanation depth based on available time
- Organizes content into stages like definition, working, applications, etc.
- Suggests related topics to help students navigate the syllabus logically

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Engineering students face challenges such as:
- Large syllabus
- Limited revision time
- Unstructured online content
- Difficulty identifying prerequisite and related concepts

This project addresses these issues using **AI-based semantic search and vector databases**.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- ⏱️ **Time-aware explanations** (2–15 minutes)
- 🧩 **Stage-wise structured content**
- 🔍 **Semantic topic search using embeddings**
- 🔗 **Related topic discovery**
- ♻️ **Incremental knowledge base update**
- 📚 **Exam-oriented explanations**

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. Raw educational text collected topic-wise  
2. Text chunking and cleaning  
3. Learning-stage detection (definition, working, etc.)  
4. Vector embedding using Sentence Transformers  
5. Storage in ChromaDB  
6. Semantic retrieval based on user query  
7. Structured explanation generation  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Sentence Transformers (MiniLM)**
- **ChromaDB (Vector Database)**
- **Flask (API Layer)**
- **HTML / CSS (UI Demo)**
- **Jupyter Notebook (Primary Evaluation Artifact)**
